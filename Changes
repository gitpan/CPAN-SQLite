Revision history for Perl extension CPAN::SQLite.

0.1_04 Jan 11, 2007
  - improve diagnostics of some of the tests using Test::More
  - check that we loaded the correct CPAN::Config in 05meta.t
    (test suggested by Andreas Koenig)
  - add auto_commit variable to the test's CPAN::Config, so
    as to work with CPAN.pm 1.88_69

0.1_03 Dec 31, 2006
  - in the t/05meta.t test, remove an underscore from the version
    strings, as older versions of CPAN::Version seem to have
    problems comparing versions with underscores.
  - don't try to update database if a $db_name-journal file
    exists, indicating another process is updating the database
  - in a regex search for Bundles within CPAN::SQLite::META,
    don't prepend 'Bundle' if special regex characters are
    present, to help in tab completion of Bundles within CPAN.pm
  - get tab completion within CPAN.pm working

0.1_02 Dec 21, 2006
  - change name of database to cpandb.sql, and make it fixed,
    as there was little need to have it configureable.
  - support 
       cpan> d ANDK/CPAN-xxx.tar.gz
    for distributions.
  - fixes to handle Bundle ids
  - undef $sth after an $sth->finish, to help with concurrent access
  - when using Test::More, use is(), rather than ok()

0.1_01 Dec 12, 2006
  - initial version, derived from a minimal version of
    CPAN::Search::Lite
